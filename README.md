# front-x


When given an unsorted list of string, and the function is called, it returns a sorted list of string except those that begin with the letter 'x' and even with the string beginning with 'x', is sorted.


# For example...

When the function front_x(words) is called;
      with words being ['demna', 'meanm', 'xdeam', 'xanta', 'ftart']
      
      Then, the fuction would return ['xanta', 'xdeam', 'deamna', 'ftart', 'meanm']
      
This function works and has been created with regard to python 2.7


Enjoy...
